# TSBDashboard

TSBDashboard is a Windows application that provides an interface for downloading and managing files from an SFTP server. It supports asynchronous file downloads, allowing users to continue with other tasks while files are being downloaded. The application also provides features for opening files in their respective viewers or editors based on the file type. For instance, Crystal Reports files are opened in the Crystal Reports viewer, and SQL scripts are executed using a script runner service. The application also includes a feature to clean up downloaded files by deleting the contents of its local storage folder. It's built using .NET and leverages the WinSCP library for SFTP operations.
